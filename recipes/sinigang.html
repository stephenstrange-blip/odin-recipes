    <h2>Filipino Sinigang (Asim Kilig!)</h2>

        This recipe uses pork as the main ingredient.<br> 
        Other proteins and seafood can also be used. <br>
        Beef, shrimp, fish are commonly used to cook sinigang.</p>

    <h3>Steps to Cook for Sinigang</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the young tamarind in 2 quarts of water for 40 minutes. <br>
            Filter the tamarind broth using a kitchen sieve or a strainer. <br> 
            Squeeze the tamarind afterwards to extract its remaining juices.</li>
        <li>Pour the tamarind broth into a cooking pot.<br> 
            Let it boil and then add the onion, pork belly, <br>
             and half the amount of the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Skim-off the floating scums, pour 1 tablespoon fish sauce, cover <br>
            and continue to simmer for 1 hour</li>
        <li>Add daikon radish and eggplants. Cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the long green pepper, string beans, remaining tomatoes, <br>
            and okra. Cook for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped water spinach stalks and season with fish sauce <br>
            and ground black pepper. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Put the water spinach leaves. Cover and turn the heat off. <br>
            Let the residual heat cook the leaves for 3 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Share and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pork Belly</strong> – This is the best cut to use when cooking sinigang, in my opinion. <br>
            The fat in the belly makes the meat moist which complements well to its tenderness. <br>
            The other cuts of pork that I use are: pork shoulder, spare ribs, and pork neck bones.</li>
        <li><strong>Young Tamarind</strong>– Use only young tamarind if you want your soup to be sour. <br>
            However, a combination of both young and ripe tamarind can be good too, <br>
            especially if you like your soup to have a hint of sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Daikon Radish</strong>- This is an optional ingredient for sinigang.</li>
        <li><strong>Taro</strong><em>(gabi)</em>- Adding taro to the dish will make the soup thicker. <br>
            This is a version of the dish known as sinigang na baboy with gabi.</li>
    </ul>
