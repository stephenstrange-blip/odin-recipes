    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Sukang iloco is a type of vinegar made from fermented sugar cane juice. <br>
        This type of vinegar has a bold flavor that can be compared to wine vinegars. <br>
        You may use the following as substitutes: cane vinegar, white vinegar, and distillled vinegar.</li>
        <li>Fresh chicken livers are commonly used to make sisig. It <br>
        had to be boiled and mashed to have a paste-like consistency. The <br>
        use of liver spread or liver pate is more for convenience <br>
        in case chicken livers are not available.</li>
        <li>Limes are great to use for sisig. However, calamansi (calamondin) is a better fit if available.</li>
    </ol>
