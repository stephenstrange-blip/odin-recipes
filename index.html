                <h1> Item 2</h1>Let's recap what's happening here. Adding a display value of flex to an element makes it a flex container. 
                The container is displayed as Block-level content in terms of how it interacts with the rest of the page. 
                When the element is converted to a flex container, its children are converted to (and laid out as) flex items.

            <article>
                <h1> Item 3</h1>You can make the container inline using an outside display value (e.g., display: inline flex),
                which affects how the container itself is laid out in the page. 
                The legacy inline-flex display value displays the container as 
                inline as well. We'll focus on how the contents of the container behave in this tutorial, 
                but if you want to see the effect of inline versus block layout, 
                you can have a look at the value comparison on the display property page.

                <h1> Item 4</h1>One issue that arises when you have a fixed width or height in your layout 
                is that eventually your flexbox children will overflow their container, breaking the layout. 
                Have a look at our flexbox-wrap0.html example and try viewing it live 
                (take a local copy of this file now if you want to follow along with this example):

                <h1> Item 5</h1>Here we see that the children are indeed breaking out of their container. 
                By default, the browser tries to place all the flex items in a single row 
                if the flex-direction is set to row or a single column if the flex-direction is set to column. 
                One way in which you can fix this is to add the following declaration to your &lt;section&gt; rule:

            <article class="even">
                <h1> Item 6</h1>We now have multiple rows. Each row has as many flexbox children fitted into it as is sensible. 
                Any overflow is moved down to the next line. The flex: 200px declaration set on the articles means
                that each will be at least 200px wide. We'll discuss this property in more detail later on. 
                You might also notice that the last few children on the last row are each made wider so that the entire row is still filled.

                The attribute "flex: (proportion unit: any number from 1 to 10) anysizepx"  
                basically states, "Each flex item will first be given anysizepx of the available space. 
                After that, the rest of the available space will be shared according to the proportion units." 
                Try refreshing and you'll see a difference in how the space is shared.
